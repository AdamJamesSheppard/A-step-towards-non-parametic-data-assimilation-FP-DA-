These codes generate alot of data and require around 15-20gb of RAM if used with current settings, RAM usage varies alot when using MPI - data generated from these algorithms is unbounded. Datasets generated for the purpose of documentation reached 58.6gb

Mathematics required to read pdf - stochastic processes/Ito Calculus/Group Theory/Partial Differential Equations/Familiarity with Markov Processes and Feller-Groups (C_0 semigroups of operators generated by continuous time markov chains)

**Ongoing Investigation** - Experimental
